I developped a sparse QR solver for large scale linear system in Python. If you have some hard problems 
(sparse matrix, each node has just a few neighbors, like in finite difference/ finite element analysis) 
to solve, and your iterative solver could not converge, then you can try with me for free at first. 

Feel free to drop me an email at HStoneQR@gmail.com to share your matrix download link / or python script to 
generate your matrix （currently accepted size to download is 1Gb, or <=100M nonzero entries with double type)
and your proposed bid price if a solution is found for a nonsingular matrix.
